# Seven

_Seven_ is a web-based image-viewing application. Its purpose is to provide an aesthetically pleasing digital-gallery-esque environment in which to view locally saved images.

I will likely build a standalone application out of the currently existing code, where I expect to add in-folder browsing through the user interface.

You can view your images [here](http://v-os.ca/seven.php) (exciting, I know), where the application is hosted.
