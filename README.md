# Seven

_Seven_ is an image-viewing application - an alternative to the default OS media viewer, essentially. Its purpose is to provide an aesthetically pleasing digital-gallery-esque environment in which to view locally saved images.

I am currently creating the standalone version of the program for desktop usage. It will include in-folder browsing through images.

More information found [here](http://v-os.ca/seven). Download coming soon.
