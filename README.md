# Seven

_Seven_ is an image-viewing application - an alternative to the default OS media viewer, essentially. Its purpose is to provide an aesthetically pleasing digital-gallery-esque environment in which to view locally saved images.

The only missing features (coming soon) are image rotation and in-folder browsing.

## Download & Installation (Windows only)

To download and install _Seven_, go to [http://v-os.ca/download/seven.zip](http://v-os.ca/download/seven.zip), which will download the packaged application. Unzip it, and put the folder wherever you like (preferably C:\Program Files). Inside the unzipped folder is the application, no installation required. If you wish to open images using _Seven_, right click on an image, click on "open with", and find `Seven.exe` wherever you put it.
