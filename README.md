# Seven

_Seven_ is an image-viewing application. Its purpose is to provide an aesthetically pleasing digital-gallery-esque environment in which to view images. It's primarily web-based, but a Windows electron build exists.

To use, simply drag an image into the open rectangle in the center of the screen.
