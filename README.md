# Seven

_Seven_ is a web-based image-viewing application. Its purpose is to provide an aesthetically pleasing digital-gallery-esque environment in which to view locally saved images.

I will likely build a standalone application out of the currently existing code, where I expect to add in-folder browsing through the user interface.

More information found [here](http://v-os.ca/seven), along with the live web application [here](http://v-os.ca/x/seven).
